# Linked-List-ADT
Linked List ADT Project of the data structure course at Diponegoro University Department of Computer Science semester 3


This is an example in how to implement linked list in C++ using Abstract Data Type. Basically there's two methods that I'm using, the first one is using Double linked link, which every node has previous and next path. and the second one is Singular, which every node only has next path. 

Every method has Circular and Non Circular, the Circular means last node is connected directly with the first node, and Non Circular means last node is not connected directly with the first node.

Here's the Code that I uploaded in this repository:
1. DLLC (Double Linked List Circular)
2. DLLNC (Double Linked List Non Circular)
3. SLLC (Single Linked List Circular)
4. SLLNC (Single Linked List Non Circular)

The node is filled by integer. You can modify it so it can be filled by string or another data type.
